# Python Practice Repository – Zero to Mastery (ZTM)

This repository contains exercises and mini-projects developed during my training in **Python programming** through the **Zero to Mastery (ZTM)** platform. It covers foundational programming concepts, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and basic data analysis.

## Repository Structure

- `Basics`: Python syntax, data types, control flow (if, loops), and functions.
- `Lists & Dictionaries`: Manipulation of core data structures in Python.
- `Functions & Arguments`: Practice with function parameters, default values, *args and **kwargs.
- `Error Handling`: Using try-except blocks and custom error messages.
- `OOP`: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and other object-oriented principles.
- `Decorators & Generators`: Advanced Python function techniques.
- `Modules & Built-ins`: Exploring Python's standard library and built-in functions.
- `Project - Image Checker`: A mini project to identify broken image links.
- `Data Analysis & Pandas`: Introduction to dataframes and basic data analysis using Pandas.
- `Testing`: Writing unit tests with Python’s `unittest` module.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3.11  
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebooks  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Requests, unittest

## Learning Goals

- Master Python fundamentals and modern features.
- Understand how to write clean, maintainable, and reusable code.
- Gain experience with OOP, error handling, and testing.
- Begin working with data using Pandas for analysis and automation.

## Repository Status

This repository will continue to grow as I build more tools, automation scripts, and explore areas such as web scraping, APIs, and time series forecasting.
